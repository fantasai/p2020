	<h1>Where can the REC track be improved?</h1>
	<div class="note">
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Maintaining and evolving</strong> a Specification is difficult:
				<ol type='a'>
					<li>Continuous development means tracking reality is a never-ending task. Declaring a spec as a REC by pulling out not-yet-normative features is burdensome.
					<li>Bug fixes can appear at all times and may need to be addressed urgently (security fixes).
					<li>Multiple transition requests and TR publications take extra time/resources.
				</ol>
			<li><strong>Patent Commitments</strong> are only secured at REC status, after implementation.
			<li><strong>Registries</strong> aren’t well handled and are all over the place (RECs, NOTEs, wikis, web pages).
		</ol>
		<p>WHATWG’s Living Standards and the W3C / WHATWG collaboration agreement give insight on how to do continuous standard development while fulfilling requirements of the W3C REC track.
    </div>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Use Cases</h1>
	<ul type='none' class='nostyle' style='padding-left: 0'>
		<li><strong>Vocabularies, Mappings:</strong> Most have little IPR, and grow in a natural incremental fashion.
		<li><strong>Registries, Profiles:</strong> Mostly no IPR commitments, incremental updates
		<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Bug-fixing of stable specifications with minimal overhead
		<li><strong>Continuous Enhancement:</strong> Incremental development one feature at a time
		<li><strong>Rapid Development:</strong> Security improvements
		<li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Coordinating update with other living standards, e.g. Fetch integration
	</ul>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Motivating Examples</h1>
	<p><a href='https://github.com/w3c/w3process/issues/79'>Issue #79</a> raised the following specs:
	<ol style='font-size: small'>
		<li>ARIA: ARIA Mappings
		<li>SVG: Beyond SVG 2
		<li>WebAppSec: CSP
		<li>Web Performance: performance timeline, …
		<li>Web Platform: WebIDL
		<li>Dataset Exchange: Beyond DCat 1.1
		<li>Timed Text: TTML Profile registry
		<li>Distributed Tracing: Trace Context Protocol Registry
		<li>WebRTC: registries
		<li>WebApps: Manifest, etc.
		<li>Service Workers: Beyond SW 1
		<li>CSS: 100 specifications and counting...
	</ol>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Goals</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Allow <strong>continuous development</strong> of specifications
		<li><strong>Simplify maintenance</strong> of existing W3C Recommendations
		<li>Secure <strong>patent commitments</strong> as soon as possible
		<li><strong>Reduce overhead</strong>
		<li>Continue the W3C commitment to <strong>Wide Review</strong> and <strong>consensus</strong>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Design Intentions</h1>
	<p>The AB has <a href='https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ac-members/2019JulSep/0027.html'>resolved</a> to address the continuous development on an accelerated basis and the W3C Process Community Group has explored several approaches.
	<ul>
		<li>Recommendation Track has problems, so let’s fix them!
		<li>Incremental improvements as a set of ideas that could be adopted individually or together.
		<li>Building on existing Process avoids undiscovered pitfalls of a brand new process track.
		<li>Avoid confusing community with a different, parallel track.
	</ul>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Proposed Fix: Patent Policy Improvements</h1>
	<div class="note">
		<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Patents licenses are only granted after REC, but implementations needed before REC.
		<br><strong>Goal:</strong> Secure patent commitments earlier, without depending on meeting REC requirements.
		<p><strong>Currently:</strong> We secure promises to license at each exclusion opportunity, but only licenses at REC.
		<p style='margin-bottom: 0'><strong>Proposal:</strong> Secure licensing, rather than just commitments to license:
		<ul style='margin-top: 0'>
			<li>on <strong>full specification</strong>, by all WG participants, at the end of each exclusion period from CR onwards
			<li><del>on each <strong>contribution</strong>, by the contributor, at the time of contribution</del>
		</ul>
		<p>See <a href=''>separate presentation on the Patent Policy (link TBD)</a>
	</div>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Proposed Fix: Streamlining Routine CR Republication Approvals</h1>
	<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Republishing WDs is automatic given WG approval, but republishing CR requires Director’s Approval. Most republication requests, however, are routine and don’t need much scrutiny.
	<p style='margin-bottom: 0'><strong>Proposal:</strong> Allow automatic Director’s Approval for straightforward cases, e.g.
	<ul style='margin-top: 0'>
		<li>Documented WG decision to publish
		<li>All changes documented
		<li>Horizontal Review groups have approved or waived their review
		<li>Resolution of each issue was satisfactory to commenter(s)
		<li>No formal objections
	</ul>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Proposed Fix: Decoupling CR Drafts from CR Snapshots</h1>
	<div class="note">
		<p><strong>Currently:</strong> Updating a CR requires external verification of work and triggers a patent exclusion period. Accommodating these reviews slows updates. (Even if we speed up Director’s approvals, legal teams want infrequent patent reviews.)
		<p><strong>Problem:</strong> CR publications lag, often significantly, behind WG’s current-work, reducing value and authoritativeness of W3C’s official publications.
		<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Address use case of Living Standards: always up-to-date, periodic patent commitment</p>
		<p style='margin-bottom: 0'><strong>Proposal:</strong> Decouple draft publications from review publications:
		<ul style='margin-top: 0'>
			<li><strong>CR Snapshot publication</strong> requires wide review, Director's approval, trigger patent review
			<li><strong>CR Draft pubication</strong> can be published by the WG without approval, no patent review
				<ul style='margin-top: 0; font-size: small'>
					<li>Changes since last Patent Review Draft must be tracked to facilitate review
					<li>Spec header adds links to previous Patent Review publication as well as previous [generic] publication.
				</ul>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Proposed Fix: Modifying a Recommendation</h1>
	<div class="note">
		<p style='margin-bottom: 0'><strong>Problem:</strong> Fixing errors in REC requires returning entire spec to CR, re-doing Process from there.
		<ul style='margin-top: 0'>
			<li>Confuses users (because the spec “loses” REC status).
			<li>Excessive process &amp; publication work for WGs and Staff.
			<li>Results in poorly-maintained RECs.
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Make it easy to propose, review, and incorporate changes without destabilizing the REC.
		<p style='margin-bottom: 0'><strong>Proposal:</strong> Create an errata proposal + approval process:
		<ul style='margin-top: 0'>
			<li><strong>Inline Errata -</strong> Allow WGs to republish annotated RECs, noting <strong>proposed changes</strong>.
			<li><strong>Review of Proposed Changes -</strong> Combine transition-like checks for wide review, adequate implementation, plus AC and patent reviews on proposed REC with changes.
			<li><strong>Updated REC -</strong> Reviewed changes can then be folded directly into an updated REC.
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Proposed Fix: Allow Adding Features to a REC</h1>
	<div class="note">
		<ul>
			<li>Some communities need a specification to represent a stable feature set.
			<li><strong>Problem:</strong> Some communities need a specification to represent continuous development.
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Currently:</strong> REC specifications cannot accept new features; a new level of the technology must be specified starting with a new FPWD.
		<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> Re-use REC maintenance process for incorporating <strong>proposed changes</strong> (above) to also allow incorporating <strong>proposed additions</strong>.
		<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Only allowed if stated in the specification prior to publishing as REC.

	<h1>Impact</h1>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Impact on Working Groups</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Allow easier maintenance paths for its Recommendations (changes and additions)
		<li>Allow keeping CR publications in sync with latest edits, without waiting on Director approval
		<li>Secure Patent Commitments earlier than REC:<br>
		    Full specification commitments at the end of each exclusion period, starting at CR
	</ol>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Impact on Legal Teams & Advisory Committee</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>AC/Patent reviews would be more frequent but with finer granularity
			<ul>
				<li>Formal patent / AC reviews rate-limited to approximately once per six months
			</ul>
			<li>Full specification commitments earlier than REC, at CR
	</ol>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Impact on Horizontal Review</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>HR groups are already under a heavy workload
			<ul>
				<li>Increasing frequency of review is good, but context-switching is costly.
				<li>Improving tooling for more granular feature review is essential to success</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Proposed fix continues to require demonstration of review at transitions/updates
			<ul>
				<li>Tied to CR Review Drafts and REC Call for Reviews (rate-limited already for legal).
				<li>Patent commitments may stall if review is slow, or if WG has failed to coordinate with HR.
			</ul>
	</ol>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
	<h1>Impact on Implementers and Users</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Early implementations get W3C RF commitments
		<li>Official specifications (on <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/'>w3.org</a>) reflect latest WG thinking.
		<li>Improved maintenance brings W3C Recommendations closer to reality.
		<li>Granular reviews of proposed changes to Recommendations.
	</ol>
